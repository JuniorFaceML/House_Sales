# House Sales in King County, USA

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a model for predicting housing prices in the King County area. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/data). An extensive analysis of the dataset was performed, which included the construction of several classical machine learning models. My personal objective was to achieve the best metrics among other participants on Kaggle, and I am pleased to report that I successfully accomplished this goal.
